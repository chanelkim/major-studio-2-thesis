# Frames of Reference

## Abstract
_Frames of Reference_ proposes how we might form discourse on computational approaches to curatorial and artistic presentations of referential new media, particularly as they relate to material culture. The paper begins with an introduction of “index” as ideologically motivated framework. An index is understood here as a product of post-processing. It requires a corpus to be “framed,” which practically speaking provides points of entry or interest. The “frame” – a device scaffolded by organizing principles determined by its author(s) – represents structural intention while also positioned as meta-data. This project centers its interest on Index of American Design, an early 20th century collection of watercolors, for its qualities well-suited for computational examination. The watercolors are precisely rendered drawings of decontextualized folk art objects deemed as artifacts of material culture. Further flattened through digitization, this collection becomes a standardized set of over 18,000 two dimensional illustrations, effectively reflecting the type of images used to train machine learning models. The Index of American Design’s historical context, as a catalog created through the lens of Euro-centric modernist bias, also provides a valuable cautionary tale for future endeavors that serve stakeholders on a national scale. _Frames of References_ proposes the items depicted in the index as data, alongside the metadata of the depictions themselves, to speculate on dialogues that are service to material culture’s preservation. The realms of craft, decorative and folk art are where we weave our stories, embedded with scales of time, place, and activity. What happens when these encoded materials are flattened and digitized before we extract information from them?
