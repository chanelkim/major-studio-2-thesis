## Abstract

_Frames of Reference_ proposes how we might form discourse on computational approaches to curatorial and artistic presentations of referential new media, particularly as they relate to material culture. The paper begins with an introduction of “index” as ideologically motivated framework. An index is understood here as a product of post-processing. It requires a corpus to be “framed,” which practically speaking provides points of entry or interest. The “frame” – a device scaffolded by organizing principles determined by its author(s) – represents structural intention while also positioned as meta-data. This project centers its interest on Index of American Design, an early 20th century collection of watercolors, for its qualities well-suited for computational examination. The watercolors are precisely rendered drawings of decontextualized folk art objects deemed as artifacts of material culture. Further flattened through digitization, this collection becomes a standardized set of over 18,000 two dimensional illustrations, effectively reflecting the type of images used to train machine learning models. The Index of American Design’s historical context, as a catalog created through the lens of Euro-centric modernist bias, also provides a valuable cautionary tale for future endeavors that serve stakeholders on a national scale. _Frames of Reference_ utilizes items depicted in the index as data, alongside the metadata of the depictions themselves, to speculate on dialogues that are in service to preserving material culture. The realms of craft, decorative and folk art are where we weave our stories, embedded with scales of time, place, and social activity. What happens when these encoded materials are curated, flattened, repurposed as visual reference? Furthermore, with digitization as a common practice, what can we learn from alternate measures for indexing within the notion of frame and reference?

## Introduction

What are the stories behind the objects and illustrations featured the Index of American Design? If Cahill dismissed the context for these objects, concerned more with aesthetics, then the lens through which the IAD took shape was one firmly based in modernist sensibility. Founding American folk art within the notion of “skillful, yet free from formal training,” blurs the lines of folk art as a category, creating questionable parameters for skillfulness and who serves as an arbiter of skill. This project proposes to search for these objects qualities through an alternate lens of material culture. In the aim to search for context, _Frames of Reference_ proposes a method for computational comparison between the design features illustrated in the IAD against those seen in online collections by institutions with a focus on folk art. The hypothesis relies on identifying visual or physical traits that may be related to certain artists, heritages, or geographic regions. Recovering these relationships facilitates our understanding of whose works were found in Cahill’s exhibitions and visual data that would qualify inclusion. Through aesthetic and visual analysis, this project hopes to provide the evidence to support the claim that modernism’s purely aesthetic priority were biased toward Euro-centric artisanal lineages.
